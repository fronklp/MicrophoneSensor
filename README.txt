This project contains two files:
microphoneSensor.c : C file that first takes in the inputs of two digital sound sensors, and then produces digital outputs that are either high or low based on the reading. 
compile_script.py : Python compile script, allowing the user to compile the c program using avr-gcc.

The following link is a demonstration of the file microphoneSensor.c: https://youtube.com/shorts/024X6dgaURs 

Programming Notes: The compile script was fit to the specific computer that was used during the demonstration, and may need to be modified to fit the proper paths and com port.
